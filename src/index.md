Hi! I am Sarah Lashinsky, an Atlanta native and a product designer at [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/).

Previously, I spent a few years sneaking hands-on learning into the public education system as a design educator with[STE(A)M Truck](http://www.steamtruck.org/), an Atlanta-based nonprofit that brings high-tech tools and technologies to the city's most under-resourced elementary- and middle-schools in the form of a mobile makerspace.
